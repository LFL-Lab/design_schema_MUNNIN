        Launchpad Wirebond

    Creates a 50 ohm launch pad with a ground pocket cutout.
    Limited but expandable parameters to control the launchpad polygons.
    The (0,0) point is the center of the necking of the launch tip.
    The pin attaches directly to the built in lead length at its midpoint

    Pocket and pad:
        Pocket and launch pad geometries are currently fixed.
        (0,0) point is the midpoint of the necking of the launch tip.
        Pocket is a negative shape that is cut out of the ground plane

    Values (unless noted) are strings with units included, (e.g., '30um')
